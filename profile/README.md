**Data For Good Concepts** is an organization that provides open source data product examples, that can be used as blueprints for individuals and teams that may not yet have the experience or the resources to develop advanced data products themselves. 

Ideally the concepts published in this organization, help especially those that aim to work on projects, that have positive social or environmental impact on our society. 

All concepts published in this organization try to cover as many best practices as possible, that are commonly known and used in the industry. The examples provided here are designed with the intention to run in a `production` environment. That includes the following but not only - coding, infrastructure setup  and deployment strategies. 

Even though we develop products to the best of our knowledge and abilities, they won't be perfect. Any support from the community to help improve is appreciated and wanted.  ❤️
 
Even though the work that is published in this organization does depend on funding right now, sponsors are always **welcome to support our mission** and help us grow.
